I don't know Mister Meyer or any member of his family. Years ago, I would go to his website once a week to get his "Reset CSS" file. I can' remember how I found his website the first time but I'm grateful for that. The background color of this website isn't much, and Mr. Meyer will certainly not come here, but it as much I can do to say «May your pain be alleviated».

And that the CSS WG decided to add [a new color name](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Jun/0312.html) is heart-warming.
