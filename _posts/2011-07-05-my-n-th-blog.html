This is my n-th blog. I stopped counting the iteration number. I have more than a dozen mysql dumps from previous attemps. My longest continuous experiment was three years old, more than 3,000 posts and at that time, I was first for "Peter" search on the google and the yahoo.

One day, I will mix everything. That day will be funny.
