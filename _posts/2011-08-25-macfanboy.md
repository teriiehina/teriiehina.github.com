Steve Jobs is leaving Apple as a CEO. Best words about it:

<blockquote>Steve Jobs Announces Retirement, All My Friends Pre-Order Retirement. - <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Spiegelmania/status/106533211865231360" title="Best words on Steve Jobs retirement">Spielgman</a></blockquote>

I don't like #fanboys. I was one of them when none of them would even consider a Mac as a calculator. It wasn't intended. I grown with a Apple keyboard below my fingers.

And since Apple get back in the trendy line, you can find a whole bunch of jerks explaining you why having a Mac makes you a better person. Yeah, right...

Ok, I may be in a bad mood as one of my goal was to enter the Apple Computer company to work with SJ. Need to find another way now.
