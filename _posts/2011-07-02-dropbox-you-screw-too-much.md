<a title="Dropbox not as protective as promised" href="http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=735">When you said you didn't protect my privacy as much as you claimed</a>, I was ok. I don't have much to hide.

When <a title="Dropbox's authentificaton failure" href="http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=821">you let anyone see my files for 4 hours</a>, I was ok, I don't have much to hide.

Now, <a title="Dropbox wants to use your files for its ads" href="http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=846">you tell me that you want to use my files to do your ads</a>:
<blockquote>We sometimes need your permission to do what you ask us to do with your stuff (for example, hosting, making public, or sharing your files). By submitting your stuff to the Services, you grant us (and those we work with to provide the Services) worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable rights to use, copy, distribute, prepare derivative works (such as translations or format conversions) of, perform, or publicly display that stuff to the extentÂ <strong>reasonably necessary for the Service. This license is solely to enable us to technically administer, display, and operate the Services</strong>. You must ensure you have the rights you need to grant us that permission.</blockquote>
So I say you are screwing with me. Thus, our relationship is over. Bye.
