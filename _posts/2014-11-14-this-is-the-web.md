I really like RSS. It is useful and convenient. Maybe too much.

I use <a href="https://feedwrangler.net">Feed Wrangler</a> to agregate my feeds. On my phone, it's <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/unread-rss-news-reader/id911364254?mt=8">Unread</a>. But on the desktop, I like the web app. It's simple and fast. Everything I like. Except for one small thing.

Every morning, my to-read list is like this:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-245 size-full" src="https://wearemobiledevelopers.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/oneday.png" alt="oneday" width="479" height="88" />

With 50 items per page, you can do the math. The problem is that Feed Wrangler's webapp only offer the option to mark everything as read. So if I start at page 1, there will certainly be new content until I arrive at the last page

.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-246 size-large" src="https://wearemobiledevelopers.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/screen-shot-2014-11-14-at-10-26-47.png?w=660" alt="Screen Shot 2014-11-14 at 10.26.47" width="660" height="340" />

Thus this small safari extension: <a href="https://github.com/teriiehina/PageWrangler">Page Wrangler</a>. It adds two buttons at the top of the page: "Mark this Page as Read" and "Toggle this Page".

Simple. Extensible. This is the web :)
