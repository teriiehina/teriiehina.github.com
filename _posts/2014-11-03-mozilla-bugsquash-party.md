This week-end, Mozilla held a <a href="http://www.eventbrite.fr/e/bug-squashing-party-mozilla-europeenne-tickets-13914938957">Bug Squashing Party</a>. Five workshops were available for two days to enable first time contributors to enter a codebase that may seems frightful at first.

You could:
<ul>
	<li>add functionalities to GFX with Nical</li>
	<li>work on the JavaScript engine with nbp</li>
	<li>improve the SMS/MMS applicatino in FireFox OS with Julien</li>
	<li>find (and report) bugs with Johan</li>
	<li>learn about Firefox OS with Dietrich</li>
</ul>
I tried to work on the JavaScript engine and it was quite fun. Even if my brain was completly washed out by Sunday night, I'm quite proud to have submitted <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1062888">a not-too-dumb patch</a> :)

Having skillful peoples guide you in such a dauting task is invaluable and while the ROI for Mozilla is clear, for the particitpants, the real value may lie elsewhere than in the code: it's the newness.

Being dropped in a new (big) codebase (and often toolchain) is a multi-level journey as there is a lot to integrate in a short time in order to be productive. It forces you to revise how good you thought you were and how to *really* improve at what you do, e.g.Â I had the opportunity to refresh my use of ctags with emacs and learn a lot about c++.

If you have a week-end to kill, this kind of event is a must-do.
