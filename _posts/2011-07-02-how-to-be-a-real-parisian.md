<ol>
	<li>Never smile</li>
	<li>Think yourself as the center of the world</li>
	<li>Think of any french not living in Paris as a redneck</li>
	<li>Stare at anybody for the sole purpose of filing him/her: below/equal/above yourself</li>
	<li>If you work in a shop, be unpleasant</li>
	<li>If you work in a brasserie, be rude</li>
	<li>Never *ever* smile (yes, same as 1, but smiling is subject to a fee... ok, I may be exaggerating)</li>
