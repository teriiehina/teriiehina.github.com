This is a stack that won't be overflown soon (stack ... overflow ... get it ? ha ha) but this is the iOS Team's little stack of books. Sure we have [great documentation from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/) and great apps (like [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash)) to read this documentation but you know, once in a while, dead trees are more pleasant. Their lacks of twitter/fb/rss clients help to focus on the content :)
