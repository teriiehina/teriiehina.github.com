You are dress like a potato couch ? According to [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/node/21610781) (not the typical geek reading) quoting researchers at Harvard Business School, published by The Journal of Consumer Research:

    You’re saying, I’m so autonomous and successful that I can afford to dress in a non-conforming way.
    
What else ? You spent most of your meetings/brainstormings/whatever doodling with a pen on dead trees ? Guess what !? According to the<a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/the-power-of-the-doodle-improve-your-focus-and-memory-1406675744?mod=trending_now_3"> Wall Street Journal</a> (still outside of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</a>, aren't we ? (1)):

    Recent research in neuroscience, psychology and design shows that doodling can help people stay focused, grasp new concepts and retain information.
And the last, but not the least, as a geek, you think you have very few friends, don't you ? Good news:

    twenty years ago, the sociologist Scott L. Feld observed that most people have fewer friends than their friends have, on average.  He called that phenomenon the «<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_paradox">friendship paradox</a>».

So yes my geek, you are full of flaws, but now you can disguise them as strategies, or phenomenon !

Science, helping geeks since 9000BC (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science#Early_cultures">AFAWK</a>).
