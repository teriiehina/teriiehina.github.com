We may not be lucky enough to have a room just for your breaks and you may not like the black liquid they call coffee you can get at the vending "coffee" machine. That really is a lack of luck.

You may, with your beloved co-workers invest in one of those fancy Nespresso machines. But those are noisy. And you know that silence is one of the programmer's best friend.

What does it leaves us with to give programmers the so precious black liquid gold ? The wonderful [Aeropress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroPress) of course. Invented in 2005, it's not the new kid on the block, but it is mostly liked for its simplicity and the quality of the coffee it makes.

So if you intend to provide good coffee to your programmers but can't solve the silence problem, Aeropress can be your best friend.
