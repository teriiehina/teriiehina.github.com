So yeah, the change wasn't that bad and they clarified their change:
<blockquote>We think it’s really important that you understand the license. It’s about the permissions you give us to run the service, things like creating public links when you ask us to, allowing you to collaborate with colleagues in shared folders, generating web previews or thumbnails of your files, encrypting files, creating backups… the basic things that make Dropbox safe and easy to use. Services like Google Docs and others do the same thing when they get these permissions (see, for example, section 11.1 of <a href="http://www.google.com/accounts/TOS">Google’s TOS</a>).</blockquote>
Still, when you host the most sensible files of yours users, you should move gently. I believe the service is still honest and good, but I realize that me using Dropbox is like Steve Jobs (yeah, SJ) using an android tablet. I should have my self-hosted files synchronization service.
