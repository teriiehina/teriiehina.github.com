It has been more than 6 weeks since [my last day at my previous job](https://wearemobiledevelopers.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/). Since then, my girlfriend and I did a road trip around Iceland, I got some last beers with friends and colleagues in Paris and finally got back to the small island I was born in: Tahiti.

I've been searching opportunities here and understood something I wasn't expecting: in Computer Sciences, in Tahiti, there is a lot of work here, but not a lot of jobs. Which means that if one wants to make a living from one's coding skill, searching a wage-earning position will not be fruitful.

So ... Freelancing ! A wonderful world where you can have a direct relation with your customer. Where you can do real consulting, counceling and advising ... Except that when you are new on the market, even with a decent portfolio, it can be hard to get a foot in the customer's door. And all the time you use on "expanding your brand" locally won't be used to "promote you brand" internationaly (sorry for the tautology).

Thus .... Toptal ! I found [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com) via [Tim Ferris' blog](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/10/04/how-to-travel-to-20-countries-and-build-a-massive-business-in-the-process/). The idea and its execution made me think "Of course". If I am able to enter Toptal, I could have access to much more exciting project, and promote the Toptal brand instead of my own. A very sane syndication, imho.
