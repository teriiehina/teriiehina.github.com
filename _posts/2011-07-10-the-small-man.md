The small man wants to run even before he learns to walk. He wants to discourse even if he is still babbling.
The small man just learned Arithmetic 101 and yet, he is dreaming about the Fields medal.
He is right in his astonishment of his own capacities but he mixes them up with super powers.

He will continue to grow, by his successes I hope, but certainly more by his failures. But he will grown.
